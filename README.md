# GeoNS (Geometric Network Simulator)

GeoNS is an open-source platform to simulate large-scale wireless networks. Contrary to the existing network simulators, which are location-transparent in their indexing, GeoNS uses location-dependent indexing in storing nodes of the network. In other words, we propose to view a wireless network as a spatial database, which allows us to use highly sophisticated spatial data structures in storing nodes of the network.
